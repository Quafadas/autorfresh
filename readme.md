Another experiment in fast-starting Scala.js applications with Laminar.

```sh
mill -w app.serve
```

- Page refresh on change

- ESModule imports (No bundler, just native ESModules in the browser) so no setup
- Playwight MCP module for vibe-code glory

TODO:
- Tests (playwright)
- Vibe-codeability check
